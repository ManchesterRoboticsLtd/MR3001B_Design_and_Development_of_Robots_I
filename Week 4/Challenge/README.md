# Week 7: Mini challenge

* The student will find the necessary files for the Mini Challenge in this folder.
* The instruction for this challenge can be found inside the presentation *MCR2_MiniChallenge_6*

### << We Encourage the students NOT to USE the files and follow the instructions during class and in the presentation to make this activity !! >>

## Description
This challenge is intended for the student to review the concepts introduced in the previous sessions.
* The activity consists of developing a kinematic simulator for the DashGo B1 RObot using the URDF files

### More information, further instructions, and some hints can be found in *MCR2_MiniChallenge_4*


  - Remember to make the nodes executable using the following commands
```
 chmod +x foo.py
```

## Rules
* This is a challenge, not a class. The students are encouraged to research, improve tune, and explain their algorithms by themselves.
* MCR2(Manchester Robotics) Reserves the right to answer a question if it is determined that the query contains a partial or a full answer.
* The students are welcome to ask only about the theoretical aspect of the class.
* No remote control or any other form of human interaction with the simulator or ROS is allowed (except at the start when launching the files).
* It is forbidden to use any other internet libraries except for standard libraries or NumPy.
* If in doubt about libraries, please ask any teaching assistant.
* Improvements to the algorithms are encouraged and may be used as long as the students provide the reasons and a detailed explanation of the improvements.
* All the students must respect each other and abide by the previously defined rules.
* Manchester Robotics reserves the right to provide any form of grading. Grading and grading methodology are done by the professor in charge of the unit.
