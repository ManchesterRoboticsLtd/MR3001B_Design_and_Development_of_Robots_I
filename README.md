# MR3001B Design and Development of Robots I

  ## Introduction
* The objective of this course, created by Manchester Robotics Ltd. (MCR2), is to equip students with the skills needed to operate mobile robots in different environments.

* This course is divided into two sections, carefully designed for the user to learn about the different aspects of ROS, from topics and messages to control and simulation of a real robot. These sections will span throughout a five-week period, with two lessons per week.

* The first part of this course introduces the basic concepts and general knowledge of the ROS environment to the user.
The second part of the course is dedicated to the analysis, control, and simulation of mobile robots in different environments. 

* This course will be based on challenges to make the student aware of the problems faced while implementing advanced intelligent algorithms in robotics.
