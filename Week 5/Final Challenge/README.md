# Week 1: Mini challenge

* In this folder, the student will find the neccessary files for Mini challenge 1.
* The instruction for this challenge can be found inside the presentation *MCR2_MiniChallenge_1*

### << We Encourage the students to NOT USE the files and follow the instructions during class and in the presentation to make this activity !! >>

## Description
This activity is intended for the student to review the concepts introduced in this session.
  * The activity consists on creating two nodes.
  * The first node will act as a simple signal generator. That will generate a sinusoidal signal.
  * The second node will act as a “process”, which will take the signal generated by the previous node and modify it, generating a “processed signal”.
  * Both signals must be plotted using the rqt_plot.
  * Different terminals must show the information of the generated signals (use it to debug).
  * A launch file must be generated to launch both nodes, terminals and rqt_plot at the same time.

## Instructions

* Download the "*coursework*" package into your *catkin_ws/src* folder (the dependencies used are rospy and std_msgs
* Complete the node files *"signal_generator.py"* and *"process.py"* inside the *"scripts"* folder, according to the problem description and isntructions.
* Complete the Roslaunch files inside the *"Launch"* folder
* Execute the nodes using the *rosalunch* command.

  - Note: You do not need to modify the CMake (unless you need to use a non-standard library)
  - Remember to make the nodes executable using the the following command inside the catkin_ws/src/basic_comms/src and catkin_ws/src/basic_comms/src
 folders 
```
 chmod +x signal_generator.py
 chmod +x process.py
```

## Rules
  * This is challenge not a class. The students are encouraged to research, improve tune explain their algorithms by themselves.
  * MCR2(Manchester Robotics) Reserves the right to answer a question if it is determined that the questions contains partially or totally an answer.
  * The students are welcomed to ask only about the theoretical aspect of the classed.
  * No remote control or any other form of human interaction with the simulator or ROS is allowed (except at the start when launching the files).
  * It is forbidden to use any other internet libraires with the exception of standard libraires or NumPy.
  * If in doubt about libraires please ask any teaching assistant.
  * Improvements to the algorithms are encouraged and may be used as long as the students provide the reasons and a detailed explanation on the improvements.
  * All the students must be respectful towards each other and abide by the previously defined rules.
  * Manchester robotics reserves the right to provide any form of grading. Grading and grading methodology are done by the professor in charge of the unit.
  
  ## Expected results
  Left image shows the nodes and the topics that results from this challenge. 
  
  Right image shows the plot of the results (using *rqt_plot*) where the blue line represents the input signal and the red line represent the output signal (processed signal).
