## Ubuntu installation for MAC
 * If the computer has an Intel processor, it is possible to use  VMWare Fusion Player V12 onwards.
 * If the computer has an M! or M2 processor, the hypervisor UTM to execute the ubuntu server 22.04 ARM, this version has no GUI, so Ubuntu Desktop must be installed manually
    (sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop)
   Use the following links:
   
   [Link 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O19mv1pe76M)
   
   [Link 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XFNUeWhsIQ)
   
 * Another way for M1/M2 processors is to use Parallels Desktop (Paid).
